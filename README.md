** Parkinson-Disease


=> Worked out the differential genotype measurement for about 276 patients with Parkinson's disease and 276 normal control individuals who have more than 408,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using Chi-square test, in R Studio. 
=> A higher the value of Chi-square value equals a higher difference between 2 data sets. 
=> Found that data predicts the possibility of a patient getting Parkinson disease in future.
